# Introduction

As mentioned in the Read Me already, Kilvin is especially build for applications build with [Fela](https://github.com/rofrischmann/fela/) as it requires a working Fela setup.<br>
The components are extracted from several projects build by Fela's Author. Therefore they might be quite opinionated. Still they include a lot of experience and combine multiple components for different projects into a small set of universal components.

## Prior Art
All components have initially been copied from  [react-layout-components](https://github.com/rofrischmann/react-layout-components). Thus if you're not using Fela and still want to use Kilvin, react-layout-components might provide pretty similar components.
